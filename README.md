SeAuto JUnit Sample Project
===========================

# Introduction
------------
This project is intended to be a template project for those wanting to quickly
implement and use SeAuto for JUnit.

# Setup instructions

## Prerequisites: 
* Download and install the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) 
* Download and install [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 
  * Any version on that page will work if you have a preference
* Firefox, for the demo to run

## To build the archetype:
````bash
mvn archetype:create-from-project
cd target/genrated-sources/archetype
mvn install
cd /to/new/project/dir
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local
````
Then, select the correct archetype from the list and follow the instructions inserting your GroupId, etc..

## To run this project or the built archetype
To run:

`mvn clean integration-test` 
or 
`mvn clean test` 

You should see a Firefox browser launch, go to Bing.com, and search for Partnet, verifying Partnet is in the list of results.

After the tests have run, JUnit reports can be found in `target/surefire-reports` and screenshots can be found in the `target/screenshot` directory.

## Run with other browsers
The other driver binaries can be downloaded and placed in the correct location by using the seauto-driver-manager plugin.

Execute the following command to download the appropriate drivers for your current operating system:

```
mvn com.partnet:seauto-driver-manager:download
```

After that, run the tests with the following command, as found in the [Configuration](//partnet.github.io/seauto/#/configuration) section of the documentation:

```
mvn clean integration-test -Dtest.config.browser=<your browser, eg. IE>
```

To run each test with its own browser type, see [*Create Tests.*](//partnet.github.io/seauto/#/createTests)

# Documentation
Please see the main SeAuto [documentation](//partnet.github.io/seauto/#/getStarted) for further information.
